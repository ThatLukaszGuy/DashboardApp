## About The Project

(Now migrated to the Goerli Testnet & self hosted parsed server)

This website can show the user the digital assets he posesses in form of a clear dashboard. It's possible to see NFT's and visit their IPFS uri, see transactions and balances. You can also set ur own username wich will be remembered.

There also 4 tabs in the 'other' section where a user can: access the latest crypto news, all relevant data about a specific coin , see exchanges and all available infos about them, even see graphs and the latest data visualised.

Due to there not being a way to log in on mobile using a crypto wallet, it's recommended to access this site from a PC/Laptop

Build on the Moralis.io API 

Relying also on API's from: CoinGecko & CryptoNews
